My name is Emir Kerem YÄ±lmaz(31785) and this is my DSA 210 project about eating habbits and sleep patterns during exam periods.

MANAGE QUALITY ROUTINE DURING EXAM PERIODS: Impact on Eating Habits and Sleep Patterns

Motivation
Academic stress can significantly alter both eating habits and sleep patterns, which are crucial for maintaining physical health, cognitive function, and emotional well-being. During exam periods, students often develop irregular eating schedules, make unhealthy food choices, or consume excessive caffeine, all of which can further disrupt sleep.
This project will analyze how my eating habits and sleep patterns change during exams compared to regular study times. Key questions include: Do I skip meals or eat more unhealthy foods under stress? Does my sleep duration decrease significantly during exams? How does poor nutrition impact sleep quality and vice versa? Are stress-induced changes in eating habits linked to sleep disturbances?

DATA SOURCES
This analysis will use two main sources of personal data:

Food Tracking Data: Using a nutrition app (MyFitnessPal, Apple Health, FatSecret) to track meal frequency, food choices, and calorie intake.
Sleep Data: Collected from a sleep-tracking app, providing details on sleep duration, quality, bedtime consistency, and interruptions.
These sources will help determine how academic stress influences both nutrition and sleep quality and whether they are interconnected.

ANALYSIS PLAN
1. Clean and Organize Eating Data: Total number of meals per day. Type of food consumed (healthy vs. processed snacks). Caloric intake trends. Meal skipping frequency.
2. Clean and Organize Sleep Data: Total sleep duration per night. Sleep quality (if available). Frequency of sleep interruptions. Bedtime and wake-up time consistency.
3. Identify Patterns and Trends: Compare average meal frequency, food types, and sleep duration during exam vs. non-exam periods. Look for relationships between poor eating habits and sleep quality (e.g., does skipping dinner lead to later bedtimes?). Examine how caffeine intake from food and drinks (coffee, energy drinks, etc.) affects sleep.

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
Visualize trends in meal frequency, food choices, and sleep duration over time. Compare averages and distributions during exams vs. non-exam periods. Identify unusual patterns, such as extreme meal skipping or severe reductions in sleep. Analyze potential correlations (e.g., increased caffeine intake leading to shorter sleep).

MODELING AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) to summarize eating and sleep patterns. Compare exam vs. non-exam periods using t-tests or percentage differences. Correlation analysis to examine relationships between:Meal frequency and sleep duration. Junk food consumption and sleep quality. Caffeine intake and sleep disturbances
Visualization Methods: Line graphs for meal frequency and sleep trends over time. Boxplots comparing sleep duration and meal skipping in different periods. Scatter plots to show relationships between eating patterns and sleep quality.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES
Changes in Eating Habits During Exams: More frequent meal skipping or irregular eating schedules. Higher intake of unhealthy snacks and processed foods. Increased caffeine consumption (coffee, energy drinks).
Changes in Sleep Patterns During Exams: Reduced total sleep duration. More frequent sleep interruptions. Later bedtimes due to late-night studying. Potential Links Between Eating Habits and Sleep:Increased caffeine and sugar intake leading to poor sleep. Skipping meals causing late-night hunger, disrupting sleep. Poor sleep affecting food choices (more cravings for junk food). Personal insights on managing food and sleep habits during stressful periods.Strategies for meal planning during exams. Setting sleep routines to improve academic performance

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
Collect and preprocess eating and sleep data over multiple weeks. Mark exam periods using my academic calendar. Perform EDA and statistical analysis to explore relationships between food intake and sleep quality. Create visuals using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Summarize key findings and recommendations in a final report.
