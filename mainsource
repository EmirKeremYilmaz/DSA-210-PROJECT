So first,in these code blocks, my aim is to investigate my exam periods.In these exam periods,how many calories i take, is there a unhealthy meals, increament for caffeine intake and what is my sleep pattern looks like are the main focus of mine.By looking at these ı want to state the hypothesis to start this investigation:
My hypothesis is that during exam periods, my eating habits are deteriorating based on calorie intake and junk foods i ate and my sleep pattern is totally deteriorating based on the quality and duration.
Firstly, ı will load the eating and sleep tracking data collected using mobile apps during my study period.

import pandas as pd

# Load the data
eating_exam = pd.read_csv('eating_data.csv')
sleep_exam = pd.read_csv('sleep_data.csv')

eating_normal = pd.read_csv('eating_data_hypothesis.csv')
sleep_normal = pd.read_csv('sleep_data_hypothesis.csv')

# Convert the Date columns to datetime type
eating_exam['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(eating_exam['Date'])
sleep_exam['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(sleep_exam['Date'])
eating_normal['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(eating_normal['Date'])
sleep_normal['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(sleep_normal['Date'])

# View first few lines
print(eating_exam.head())
print(sleep_exam.head())
